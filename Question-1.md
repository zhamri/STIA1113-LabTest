## Question 1:

Given the arrays below:

```java
int[] age = {20, 21, 22, 18, 23, 24, 25, 51, 26, 70, 27, 28};
double[] weight = {56.1, 70.5, 65.4, 49.3, 55.8};
```

Write a complete Java program which has the following methods:
1. method `totalAge` which calculate the total age.
1. method `averageAge` which calculate the average age.
1. method `countAgeMore50` which count the number of ages more than 50;
1. method `maxWeight` which find the maximum weight.
1. method `minWeight` which find the minimum weight.

## Example of output:
```
Total Age: 355
Average Age: 29.5833
Age More Than 50: 2
Maximum Weight: 70.5
Minimum Weight: 49.3
```
